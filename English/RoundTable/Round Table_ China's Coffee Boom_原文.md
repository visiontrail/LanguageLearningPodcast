发言人1   00:04
Discussion keeps the worlds turning.

发言人2   00:07
and this is round table. 

发言人2   00:13
You're listening to roundtable. I'm yo. Hong Li n, joined by Steve and yu Shan. Some countries, like their coffee black, others with cream and sugar. 

发言人2   00:22
China, China is putting IT in hotpot and steaming IT into rice rolls.

发言人2   00:27
If coffee had feelings, it'd be just as surprised.

发言人2   00:30
But besides these fun creations, roundtable invites you to take a look at China's coffee boom and its role in the global market, and Monday's marked new beginnings, a fresh chance to chase goals, push boundaries and embrace challenges. 

发言人2   00:46
Here on the show.

发言人2   00:47
We want to help you create your best Monday's by bringing you words of inspiration to feel your mind and spirit for the week ahead. 

发言人2   00:56
Before that, hold on to your mugs, coffee lovers. Because today's roundtable is serving up some freshly brewed coffee stories just for you. 

发言人2   01:05
Did you know the global coffee market has recently experienced a rocketing Price search.

发言人2   01:10
How about the fact that the coffee industry in southwestern China's inland province is gaining growing international popularity as a trend chaser or even a trend setter? 

发言人2   01:21
What is your most innovative way to enjoy this beverage? Welcome to our special coffee episode, and we have a special coffee episode.

发言人2   01:30
Because today, here on roundtable, all three of us are coffee lovers, aren't.

发言人2   01:35
So I want to ask this, what kind of coffee lovers are you, Steve.

发言人3   01:40
Ah when I lived in canada, IT was always with two cream, two sugar, milk and sugar. 

发言人3   01:47
But after I moved to Asia, I stopped drinking IT with cream and sugar, and I just started drinking a black.

发言人3   01:54
Then I realized the ice black is my favorite. And now, even in the winter time, it's ice americano for me.

发言人2   02:02
Do you care about different beings where they from different way to brew? 

发言人2   02:07
Or are you a coffee snob .

发言人3   02:09
or a not a coffee snob per person? If it's if it's good, it's good. If it's not, it's not.

发言人3   02:16
I do like a nice, strong cup of coffee.

发言人2   02:19
how about you.I am not .

发言人4   02:21
nerdy to the point that I can tell the difference either is just if a smells good in the air, the aroma of coffee from one particular store tracks me, then yes, so walk in and get a cup, but for me, at this point the cheaper, the better, the better, the better.

发言人4   02:35
But sometimes I feel like some brands, especially some brands, they are overpriced, they are definitely overpriced, at least for the Chinese market.

发言人3   02:43
But hey, for every market, coffee is getting more and more and more and more expensive.

发言人2   02:48
But if you say the cheaper, the better, and pretty sure the coffee snobs would not acknowledge you as a coffee ruffle.

发言人3   02:54
you know what the my dad loves coffee, but he prefers instant coffee to prove coffee. 

发言人3   03:01
Now remember, this is the man who washes his hair or used to wash his hair with dish.

发言人3   03:06
So yeah, no, not the three and one that would be an upgrade for you.

发言人2   03:10
okay. 

发言人2   03:10
So I think I have we have made the point that there are different types of coffee lovers, but all kinds of coffee lovers would say that it's almost a must in their life, maybe not every day, but at least several times a week.

发言人2   03:26
So IT is important to us to know that actually, a Price surge in the coffee market has just happened.

发言人2   03:33
Yeah.

发言人4   03:33
exactly.

发言人4   03:34
That's so saddening to for all of us to hear, because lately, the global coffee market is absolutely in experiencing this notables Price surge because well, yeah, just in last year, the global coffee prices saw a significant jump of almost 40%, reaching a multi year high. 

发言人4   03:53
And notably, the arabica coffee, which is one type of um the bitter um say coffee beans. Yeah the the the ones that have that have a better quality IT.

发言人4   04:04
Um um well, well, it's the futures on the icy exchange with which is another term for the benchmark for coffee deals around the world, and that has witnessed a dramatic 70% increase since last november.

发言人4   04:19
And this isn't the first time we hear there's a ah prize search for coffee and for this year, for, say, 2024, in particular, one of the primary drivers of the Price surge is actually the adverse weather in many major coffee producing regions.

发言人4   04:34
And that includes countries like Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil thus experiencing extreme weather events in the say, the 23, 20, 23 to 2020 four period, leading to this, say, reduced coffee production and consequently just racing up the Price when they're exporting their coffee in Brazil.

发言人4   04:55
Being one of the top coffee growers around the globe is significantly impacted the global availability, global coffee availability in general and lower production in these key regions has definitely reduced the availability of coffee beans in the global market. 

发言人4   05:13
And that's just big talks in general.

发言人4   05:15
Day to day coffee are well, you're most likely to see we uh well us coffee lovers getting a bit more expensive, paying a bit more when you're getting a cup of coffee.

发言人3   05:25
Yeah, the cost of wholesale arabica beans. 

发言人3   05:30
That that that's the most popular on the planet. By the way, it's surpassed $4a pound for the first time this month.

发言人3   05:39
That's doubled over the past year, running up from less than two bucks a pound in january 2024 to a record $4.30a pound in early february of of this year. 

发言人3   05:53
That's a massive increase in Price right? And for customers, I mean, we're still dealing with high food costs.

发言人3   06:01
The increased costs of different fruits and vegetables and meats, and that's been impacting consumers in many parts of the world. And now coffee, too. 

发言人3   06:12
And the retail Price of ground coffee IT hit an all time high of $7a pound in january.

发言人3   06:19
That's up 75% from $4 in january of 2020. That's from government data via cbs news. So that's the way IT is now. 

发言人3   06:29
And they also say that coffee drinkers are likely to see even steeper prices over the next few months.

发言人3   06:35
There was a quote from Andrea illy, who's the chairman of the Italian roaster and global retailer illegal, predicting that bean prices could climb 25% this year.

发言人3   06:45
And in the meantime.

发言人2   06:46
we see that while China has its own domestic production, the current global coffee Price surge is likely to impact to the Chinese market, as well as IT is, a steel relies significantly on importantly on imports, and higher global prices will likely translate to increased costs for roasters and consumers here in China, and IT will potentially affect consumption patterns and the profitability of coffee business.

发言人2   07:14
And I think this is more reason to believe that we need to be nicer to the planet because we wanted to treat us better. 

发言人2   07:23
So maybe including more Green in the city could be a better idea, echoing a little bit to our first topic.

发言人2   07:30
And that being said, um coffee lovers here in China for the past decades have actually being increased to start with. And a number of coffee lovers are increased.

发言人2   07:42
And also the coffee industry here in the Chinese market is also gaining more and more, let's say, momentum and the products are gaining attention on the global market. 

发言人2   07:55
And one very notable place for the coffee industry would be Yunnan province isn't IT. Yeah.

发言人4   08:01
I mean, a lot of the times when say, well, just for the record, I also buy instant coffee in the say, grocery stores.

发言人3   08:11
And many为什么you should introduce you to my father，you get along swimming swimmingly。

发言人4   08:17
I mean, in a lot of the brands that's um on the shelf of supermarket these days, they will um label themselves as while our beings are produced in southern China's Yunnan province. 

发言人4   08:29
Because nowadays Yunnan province has stands out that China's largest coffee cultivation region, that's accounting for over 98% of the country's coffee planting area and production as well.

发言人4   08:41
So yun, na n, now that we're talking about IT, is considered as China's most suitable region for growing coffee, and here is a very interesting story that I found. 

发言人4   08:52
Hell did something like coffee got into yun. Na n. And that's a new discovery for me as well.

发言人4   08:58
Because apparently, coffee's journey in China began over a century ago, and that's in the 19 oh four, around a hundred and 20 years ago. 

发言人4   09:08
That's a french traveler planting the first coffee tree in the village of the local E.

发言人4   09:14
Ethnic minority nested deep in Yunnan s mountains, and around the same period of time, the coffee sees introduced from Myanmar also took roots in the city of ray Li in west Yunnan. 

发言人4   09:27
That's right, beside the China mm on border line as well.

发言人4   09:31
So that became the early source for China's coffee industry, and IT also Marks the earliest recorded coffee introduction in China. So yeah, only 120 years only.

发言人3   09:44
It's a long time, right? 

发言人3   09:46
It's a cool. It's a cool. backs. story. I didn't know, right.

发言人3   09:50
I didn't even know that China had a place that grew coffee and grew IT very, very well. 

发言人3   09:57
One of our coworkers, he's a coffee lover, too, and I was asking him, oh, where do you get your beans? 

发言人3   10:01
Because I was complaining, you know, going to local brands here and buying beans was kind of expensive. And he said, oh, from Yunnan.

发言人3   10:10
And I said, why? Yeah, cause I didn't know. I didn't know, right? And he he filled me. And he educated me on the area. 

发言人3   10:19
They have a wonderful geographical and climatic condition that allows IT for perfect coffee coffee cultivation.

发言人3   10:28
So IT works there because of the landscape.

发言人3   10:31
They have mountainous regions, they have sloping landscapes, they have fertile soil, they've enough sunshine, enough rain, a difference between day and nighttime temperatures, enough of a difference that it's good for growing coffee there that allows for the sugar content to go up in the coffee, cherries. 

发言人3   10:49
And what all of those things together mean is that, you know, they're beans. There have a distinct flavor profile. Really nice coffee. 

发言人3   10:58
They call IT rich without bitter, fragrant without strong, and slightly fruity.At the same time.

发言人4   11:04
Very nice. 

发言人4   11:05
Yeah, yeah.

发言人2   11:06
And one other reason that I think Yunnan can be really good at coffee industry is that they have actually a really long history of tea making. 

发言人2   11:18
Poor is one place in Yunnan.

发言人2   11:20
IT is also the name of a famous, very nice kind of tea in China.

发言人2   11:26
China with that kind of experience in history, you know is quite good at um benefiting from a certain kind of beverage and using IT, or let's say, doing or making different inventions and creations with this different, this specific kind of beverage. 

发言人2   11:45
And and there's one thing on running table. We've talked about this. Ah I think it's last year, Yunnan has added one, a university major that is the coffee industry.

发言人2   11:57
And for the coffee major, they do not only teach their kids how to call by by saying kids, I mean college, kids call college students how to cultivate different types of coffee beans, how to create different ways of enjoying coffee, how to make coffee, how to brand their own coffee, and also how to get creative in the consumption of coffee.

发言人2   12:22
Because traditionally, definitely you would sip your morning coffee, at your dinner table, but your name is doing much, much more than that.

发言人3   12:30
Yeah, can we talk about some of these examples, please? 

发言人3   12:32
Because I don't know if I'm gonna love all of these or not. They are creative.

发言人4   12:37
I know, right.

发言人4   12:38
I was so confused when they first see IT, but here is what's going on in Yunnan because they are actually doing like coffee full course meal. 

发言人4   12:46
That means one entire table filled by dishes that has some coffee or coffee element that's put inside during the cooking process. 

发言人4   12:55
For example, there is a coffee restaurant in west tune N.

发言人4   12:59
City of bao Shan that's offering dishes like hear this coffee leaf, tempura, coffee, meat, jelly, coffee, die style mixed rice noodle, that one's .

发言人3   13:11
interesting coffee, rice noodles.

发言人4   13:15
and coffee, meatballs and coffee stewed chicken with some dishes.

发言人4   13:19
You know, just having a distinct coffee flavors, and I would assume some others just using coffee as, say, a way of introducing other flavor in instead of just you know making IT full, making everything tastes like coffee.

发言人4   13:33
And locals in Yunnan also reportedly used coffee as this type of seasoning, just like salt and pepper, like everyday seasoning. 

发言人4   13:41
They use coffee as a way of enhancing the general flavor, much like Sichuan people using peppercorns. Yeah, that's very interesting to notice as well, especially for tourists.

发言人4   13:52
If you wanna travel down south to southern China's Vietnam province, there's to say an emerging coffee tourism destination there as well.

发言人4   14:01
What we call kadu or more directly, the coffee traveling or the coffee tourism with featuring visitors that's encouraged to just explore local coffee shops and taste beans from different regions. 

发言人4   14:14
Because we know in Yunnan, they have all different variety of of beans, not just arabica or the say different varieties of arabica beans. There, they also have local beans.

发言人4   14:26
Say what we call the the the local Yunnan beans, the derived from the uh say the bean's family as well, so just taste to different flavors in different places is fun.

发言人3   14:39
II can get on board with the rice noodles. 

发言人3   14:42
Okay, the stewed chicken in coffee. okay.

发言人3   14:45
That sounds maybe like a unique flavor. How about this? I'm not sure the Guangzhou coffee hot pot.

发言人2   14:54
so I would love to draw.

发言人3   14:56
There's a hot pot restaurant in Guangzhou that's gotten a lot of attention because they serve this coffee flavored individual hotpot set, and you need to pour the bag of coffee into your hotpot to create this coffee infused broth for boiling all your typical hot pot ingredients.

发言人3   15:18
I suppose beef, I guess, is the is the main ingredient. And thoughts on this one .

发言人2   15:24
I was thinking about cheese fondue kind of hotpot like sweet. 

发言人2   15:29
Yeah, the word cookies cannot be in. Well, no. Oh, no, it's not that no, it's just real hot pot.

发言人3   15:35
Yeah, it's not a cup of coffee with your hot pot. 

发言人3   15:38
This is a cup of coffee inside your hot pot.

发言人2   15:41
Yes, and there are coffee rips. 

发言人2   15:44
There are coffee act heart, which I've tried.

发言人2   15:46
Actually, I enjoy coffee egg chart, but I think these examples explain that here on the Chinese market, we are definitely not short of inventions. 

发言人2   15:57
And these inventions are, you know, kind of fun. You can try different things. 

发言人2   16:01
I remember several years ago, the croissant ice cream was definitely a thing, and dipping your french fries in ice creams was a thing. Oh.

发言人3   16:10
I am not new.I did not .

发言人2   16:12
have a and .

发言人3   16:13
also crashing .

发言人2   16:14
your croissant into these really thin. 

发言人2   16:17
Yes, yes, biscuit like stuff, crunchy, crunchy. Yes, that was a thing.

发言人2   16:22
And now with coffee, we are looking at coffee, ah pork, sometimes in some places they would pair up the pork and with um and also ribs with coffee. Oh.

发言人2   16:33
yeah.

发言人3   16:33
that's like American style barbecue, though you take coffee grinds or coffee grounds, and then you mix IT with like garlic powder and other spices. 

发言人3   16:42
And then you rub IT on steak or ribs or something. And then you grill IT. Yeah, that's that's ah that's an old style method.

发言人2   16:49
yeah.

发言人2   16:50
So my feeling is that these new inventions are definitely new, but they imply that we're accepting coffee or welcoming coffee or enjoying coffee to an extent that we started to trying to see whether or not we can blend IT into our everyday cuisine in different ways. 

发言人2   17:09
We're seeing things because for tea, for example, actually tea flavored cuisine is quite popular here in China.

发言人2   17:17
You would see tea flavored or tea, um the kind of little snacks or cookies with tea as an element. You see tea leaves being incorporated into a certain dish. 

发言人2   17:31
You would fry the tea as well as other meat together. So it's a sign of Chinese people accepting coffee to a certain degree. yeah.

发言人3   17:40
And I think that these these trends, I mean, it's always fun to experiment with foods and flavors, right.

发言人3   17:46
And I don't know if nationally, these new attempts will catch on, but I think locally, it's a smart move because you none is the coffee production capital of China, right.

发言人3   18:00
So IT makes sense for them to have coffee, hot pot restaurants or a coffee, meatballs or coffee. 

发言人3   18:08
This coffee, that coffee, this coffee that he might not catch on here in Beijing, but Beijing's, not the coffee producing capital of the country. So White, White, White wood. 

发言人3   18:17
What I mean is it's another reason to put you on, on, on the map, and it's a tourist attraction thing, right.

发言人3   18:23
All of these different, unique style foods and restaurants. I think .

发言人4   18:26
it's kinda cool and hopefully isn't just a temporary save trend that just made to be there to attract people's attention temporarily.

发言人4   18:36
But rather, people can really discover the say the cross border culinary combination of coffee and different types of, say, logo cruising altogether. 

发言人4   18:48
And and yeah, just as long as the food quality is just very well designed and is you know people paying efforts in order to make that dish unique instead of just trying to grab eyeballs.

发言人4   19:01
And yeah, of course, we'll definitely see this trend having a longer say lasting period and maybe even evolving into more innovative designs as well. And I think it'll .

发言人3   19:11
and I can use nova Scotia where I'm from as an example, right.

发言人3   19:15
Um even some of the lobsters that you get in China probably come from nova Scotia where I'm from. 

发言人3   19:20
If you I took my wife to nova Scotia, we went together, and every restaurant we went to rob lobster.

发言人3   19:26
This lobster, that lobster, this lobster, that SHE asked me, do people eat anything else? Cycle lobster chowder, lobster mac and cheese, lobster, everything. 

发言人3   19:35
So that's been in that way for a super long time. In nova Scotia, you have to take advantage of your resources, right? 

发言人3   19:41
And you have to market those resources, to to your local people and also to your tourists who come to visit as well. I think IT will be in Yunnan.

发言人3   19:49
I think IT will be a long lasting thing. N.

发言人2   19:51
I would love to see more and more beans from Yunnan getting recognition on the global stage, and if they if the coffee boom yun nan can continue to flourish, we will be able to enjoy more, better and maybe cheaper beings in our daily coffee as well. 

发言人2   20:10
You're listening to roundtable coming up next motivation on Monday.Oh.

发言人1   20:14
oh, oh, oh, my god.

发言人4   20:23
Welcome to motivational .

发言人2   20:26
Mondays with myself neo. 

发言人2   20:28
Honey and Steve Hatherley and usha n. So what is some wisdom stories or insights that to you, Steve, can share to power our listeners through the days ahead.

发言人3   20:40
And I don't think this qualifies as um because this is a quote from Carrie Bradshaw the television show sex and the city population. 

发言人3   20:50
I believe in the 1990s, our early two thousands. Anyway, the quote is this we were talking about shopping earlier today.

发言人3   20:58
This is the quote Carrie said. Shopping is my cardio, and the reason I chose that as my quote today, we always are told what we need to do to make ourselves feel better, right.

发言人3   21:13
Reduce your screen time, go to the gym, don't eat too many cards, go to bed early, wake up early. Do this, do that, do that for a healthier lifestyle, it's exhausting. 

发言人3   21:24
Isn't IT all the advice from everyone telling us what to do.

发言人3   21:29
So this quote shopping is my cardio implies SHE wasn't one to go to the gym seven days a week, but shopping for something is something that made her happy. 

发言人3   21:39
So I took this quote for motivation to mean. So you don't need to listen to all the advice from everyone all the time on every topic.

发言人3   21:49
Find something that makes you feel good and do that once a day, or at least once a week, something just for you. 

发言人3   21:56
And more specifically, on the topic of shopping, buy yourself something nice every once in a while, treat yourself to a little something.

发言人3   22:05
Shopping is her cardio. I like IT.

发言人2   22:08
Yeah, that is very sweet and doing something nice for ourselves is sometimes something we neglect. 

发言人2   22:13
We do something nice to our four hour families, to our friends, for the work.

发言人2   22:19
But yes, like Steve said, once in a while, do something nice just .

发言人3   22:22
for you and something that you want, not something that somebody else told you that you should be. 

发言人3   22:27
Do that to learn my say cold, that I'm going to refer to the to to today is something that's kind of similar to what Steve mentioned.

发言人4   22:37
But it's more on ah um completing a bigger project quote, as in the treating yourself nicely a little bit more everyday equal. 

发言人4   22:48
So this one is from Kenneth goldsmith, from a book, um and hear this out, if you work on something a little bit every day, you end up with something that's massive.

发言人4   22:59
And I am choosing this cold because of something that's going on with me, say, a project that I am to finish lately. 

发言人4   23:07
That's a book reading match I'm trying to maintain with my boyfriend because we've been keeping this long distance relationship for over a year now. 

发言人4   23:15
And there's literally not much we can do at this point.

发言人4   23:19
So I think one day, we just pointed out them, how about sharing the reading experience of one book, let's name one book that we're both interested and let's finish a little bit every day. 

发言人4   23:31
See, that's the problem for me.

发言人4   23:32
I can't really maintain that, say, a very long project and just force myself to do a little bit every day. 

发言人4   23:38
But nowadays, as a has been going on for over a week, I feel the power of just doing one step every day, maybe just one part of what of a chapter instead of one whole chapter in one afternoon. 

发言人4   23:49
And that's helping. So that's something that I hope to share here on motivational Monday.

发言人4   23:54
So and then maybe just you and this time next month is going to end up to become my happy place. Oh.

发言人2   24:01
yeah, that's very nice. 

发言人2   24:02
And I think IT definitely helps when you start a new tradition, a new habit, IT will lead you into a new maybe lifestyle. 

发言人2   24:09
Didn't think of and starting Monday would be a good day to start.

发言人2   24:13
So for those of you who are listening, maybe you can try start your own tradition as well after you shun. And for me, in my motivation on Monday is actually from Bruce Lee.

发言人2   24:25
It's a Bruce Lee quote and says, absorb what is useful, discard what is not, and add what is uniquely your own. For me, usually I will think about the first two parts. 

发言人2   24:37
More often, I think about absorb what's useful, making sure to learn from different sources, taking knowledge, keep what benefits me, of course, and discard what is not.

发言人2   24:47
Yes, while we're learning, while we're improving ourselves, we need to get rid of unnecessary, outdated or unhelpful ideas, techniques and beliefs. 

发言人2   24:58
Maybe that is a way to like trim a tree to trim our personality and our skills, because you cannot really put all of your time and energy to all of different things. 

发言人2   25:08
You have to choose one thing.

发言人2   25:10
