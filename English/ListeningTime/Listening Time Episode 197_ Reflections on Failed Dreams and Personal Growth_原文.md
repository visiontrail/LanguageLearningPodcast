发言人1   00:50
What I mean by this is I want to talk about some different dreams, distant goals that I had when I was younger, as I failed at that did not come true.

发言人1   01:06
I've had plenty of dreams throughout my life that I have a abandoned, and I thought IT would be fun to talk about this.

发言人1   01:20
And I kind of make fun of myself because uh it's kind of fun to look back and think about what goals I had and uh see that some of em were not that realistic。

发言人1   01:36
And now it's kind of fun to look back and make fun of myself，laugh at myself a little bit. Ah and hopefully you'll enjoy hearing about all this.

发言人2   02:50
Are your ears ready.

发言人2   02:52
You know what time IT is? It's listening time.

发言人1   02:58
Okay, let me talk about some of my failed dreams from the past, some things that I dreamed about doing.

发言人1   03:07
I had the goal of doing one day, but uh I failed, I abandoned these dreams, so the first one I want to mention is my dream to become a filmmaker.

发言人1   03:24
I have talked about this a few times throughout the years of in different episodes, so I some of you might remember this, but I went to film school when I was 18 years old. 

发言人1   03:42
I moved out of my parents'house.

发言人1   03:45
I moved to los Angeles.

发言人1   03:47
I lived in the middle of LA，and I went to a film pool that was located on the universal studios campus, so every day I had to go on to the universal studios campus to attend my film school.

发言人1   04:11
So IT was pretty cool actually and when I was a senior in high school, when I was in my last year of high school, uh, this is really when my dream to become a filmmaker was at its strongest, and I spent so much time watching movies and getting inspired, trying to watch the greatest movies from the past and learn from the story，the cinematography, the acting, all of that.

发言人1   04:56
And I had the goal, the distant goal of being a director one day.

发言人1   05:05
Now that I talk about this, eh IT sounds ridiculous to me, because there is no way that I ever would have been a film director, but for some reason I had dream. 

发言人1   05:21
And so I thought that if I watched a ton of movies, I would learn a lot.

发言人1   05:28
And of course, I thought that if I went to this film school, uh, I would establish some connections in the film industry, and I would learn to make movies well. 

发言人1   05:44
And so I went to that film school.

发言人1   05:47
And uh I'll say that, that film school was a very good in the sense that you actually get a lot of experience making movies. 

发言人1   06:01
It's not uh like completely about the theory of making movies.

发言人1   06:07
You're not just in a classroom for hours, you're actually making short films from like the first week on um when we say the first week on that word on there means from the first week and after that, like starting from the first week and continuing after that. 

发言人1   06:31
So from the first week on, ah I was making short films.

发言人1   06:37
So ah IT was a great experience in terms of actually making movies, learning how to do everything because I learned everything, I filled every role, every position, on different film sets, like sometimes I was uh the cinematographer, sometimes I was just the person doing the lights, the sound person, the director, the actor.

发言人1   07:15
So I did a lot. And so someone who really wants to be a filmmaker, they would probably learn a lot and get a lot of valuable experience there。

发言人1   07:29
However, I realized very quickly that film making was not for me. I hated the film industry, I hated the culture of this industry. Uh, I just knew.

发言人1   07:46
I think after a month or so that I was not gonna do this, I did not wanna be there. I did not want to be in that world, in that environment.

发言人1   07:59
So I dropped out, meaning I abandoned film school. After six months.

发言人1   08:08
IT was supposed to be a one year program, and I did half of IT and said, I'm done and I left. So that is one of my failed dreams.

发言人1   08:23
I don't even watch many movies nowadays, so I've completely abandoned everything about movies, film making, the art form of making a movie is still pretty cool in my opinion，but it's not for me, and I will never do IT so that's my first failed dream.

发言人1   08:48
The next one is my dream to become a professional athlete.

发言人1   08:54
This one sounds maybe even more ridiculous than my first one, because I was never nearly good enough in any sport to have that dream, but when I was Young, like many Young kids, I think I had the dream to become a professional athlete and not just in one sport.

发言人1   09:21
Believe IT or not, it's not like I just chose the one sport I was good at, and I made that my goal. No, I actually thought this way about more than one sport.

发言人1   09:36
Uh and I will say that I was decent at most of these sports, so I was a decent athlete growing up, I played a bunch of different sports, so I was always pretty decent。

发言人1   09:57
I was never like terrible, at these sports well at one of them。Yes, I'll get to that in a minute. But um first of all, let me mention basketball.

发言人1   10:12
So basketball was the one sport that I actually played.

发言人1   10:17
Kind of seriously, I never played on my high school varsity team, meaning the top level team, but I did play at the lower levels, and uh I actually was pretty good at basketball when I was younger, like not when I was an older teenager，but when I was eight 9:10I definitely was better than most kids。

发言人1   10:51
And one of the reasons was because I was tall, so the height that I am now，I was this height when I was 13, so I was fully grown at a Young age, and so I had an advantage over other kids, but when I lost that height advantage and the other kids caught up to me, meaning they uh became taller and some of them passed me. 

发言人1   11:30
Then I kind of lost my height advantage.

发言人1   11:34
And I was always decent, but um I definitely wasn't anywhere near as good as I needed to be in order to think about playing professionally, so that didn't work for a brief period of time.

发言人1   11:54
I thought that I wanted to do play football professionally.

发言人1   12:00
This is never something I said out loud to any one, but in my mind I thought I could do IT, and it's funny because I never even played football on a team before, so I don't know where I got that goal from, but I thought that I would be really good, and I really liked watching football.

发言人1   12:25
Uh but uh I realized very quickly that a ridiculous goal, and I never even ended up playing football on a team, so I failed with that one pretty quickly, and I also, for a brief period of time, wanted to be a baseball pitcher. 

发言人1   12:47
The person who pitches the ball and throws IT at the batter, who hits the ball, and I was pretty bad at baseball.

发言人1   12:59
This was the one sport that I just was not good at at all I was not good at hitting the ball. I could never hit the ball well, but I thought that maybe I could be a pitcher.

发言人1   13:18
So I went through this phase where I would practice pitching to my dad or to my neighbor, and I loved trying to throw the different types of pitches my dad even built a thus net that we put in our side yard uh on the side of our house，where I could pitch into the net, and uh IT would catch the ball for me. 

发言人1   13:50
So I really liked doing that for a certain time period.

发言人1   13:55
And then just like the other sports, that kind of faded out and I dropped that goal. So that's another one. And then one more sport that ah I played.

发言人1   14:13
And I would say that I didn't ever really think that I would be a professional at this sport, but I have thought that I was pretty good and that I could have become a professional if I had wanted to. 

发言人1   14:31
And that is tennis. 

发言人1   14:33
And I don't think I could have become a professional now when I look back, but I will admit that I was pretty good at tennis, and that was probably my best sport.

发言人1   14:48
I was better at tennis then I was at these other sports, and I remember that I could serve really fast serve in tennis.

发言人1   15:01
Uh this word refers to when you throw the ball up and you hit IT to start that point that's serving.

发言人1   15:11
So I was able to serve really fast compared to other kids, and I think I could have gone pretty far with IT, like I might have been able to play in college. 

发言人1   15:25
May be, but I stopped pretty early because I wanted to play other sports. So I didn't continue with tennis.

发言人1   15:35
So who knows how far I could have gotten with that sport, but I wouldn't have become a professional? Okay, another failed dream that I had was to be an author。

发言人1   15:52
And technically, I am an author because I have published a book, I published my short stories, my short mystery stories that are for english learners, specifically Spanish speaking and Portuguese speaking english learners who want to read in english with a translation in their language. 

发言人1   16:18
So II actually did uh publish a book, and you can still find that book.

发言人1   16:25
Uh I don't usually link IT down below anymore, but if you go back to some of my older episodes, uh you'll hear me talk about those short stories。

发言人1   16:37
So if you're a Spanish or a Portuguese speaker, that might be interesting for you, but I'm not talking about that type of book.

发言人1   16:46
Um I wanted to be an author of a fiction book, specifically like literary fiction, really a deep writing with a significance, meaning, symbolism, the kind of books that we read in high school, right? 

发言人1   17:09
I've always loved reading fiction. I've always loved classic literature. Those books that we read in high school. I actually have always loved that.

发言人1   17:21
And uh I had the goal uh of writing, and books like this at least one, and I started several different novels throughout the years，but I could never even get close to finishing one.

发言人1   17:39
I think the farthest I ever got when writing a novel was probably writing one quarter of a book，so I never even got close to finishing one, and I love writing still to day. 

发言人1   17:58
I love creative writing. I don't do IT uh nowadays.

发言人1   18:05
Ah how I did IT in the past, but I do still like writing songs and stuff like that. So I think I'll love writing. Ah but I don't know if I'll ever write a full length novel. 

发言人1   18:22
Probably not. And that's why I'm including IT here.

发言人1   18:27
I don't think I have IT in me when we say you don't have IT in, you IT means that you just don't have that ability. Uh you don't have um the capability to do something.

发言人1   18:42
So I don't think I have IT in me to write a full novel, to be honest, ah I might write more short stories in the future.

发言人1   18:55
I've written several short stories, and that's fun, and it's a lot easier than writing a novel, but I don't know if I'll ever realize that goal of writing a full length novel. 

发言人1   19:12
Probably not. So it's a lot harder than I thought IT would be when I was younger.

发言人1   19:20
And I don't think I'm super talented at that type of writing.

发言人1   19:26
Uh I think that in the past, I thought I was talented, but now if I'm being honest with myself, I am talented at writing, but in other forms, not the form of a full length novel. 

发言人1   19:44
So I'm including that ah here in this failed dreams episode and one other failed dream that I wanted to mention is opening a language school。

发言人1   19:58
So in the past, I actually wanted to open a physical school where many languages were taught, like Spanish, Portuguese, Greek, french, ETC.

发言人1   20:13
And I have studied at a couple language schools before, and I liked that environment.

发言人1   20:23
Um I always thought of IT as a language learners paradise, where language learners uh can go and learn all these different languages and interact with other language learners and teachers.

发言人1   20:39
And that was a goal that I had in the past, but now I'm glad that I didn't end up pursuing that goal because I probably would've run into all the problems that people run into with language schools in the sense that IT might have become too much of a classroom experience where it's not optimal, where there are too many learners in the class and only one teacher and the learners aren't able to talk a lot.

发言人1   21:21
And you know, if you've been to that type of language school before，um there are a lot of downsides to IT.

发言人1   21:32
I still think they're great, and I will always kind of have um a soft spot for a language schools, which means that I'll always have some positive feelings about language schools.

发言人1   21:47
I met my wife at a language school, so uh I'm not here to talk bad about language schools, but I don't know if I would be able to really apply my philosophy regarding language learning。

发言人1   22:05
Um 100%, if I were running a language school, there would be some complications, I would say, but at least this goal kind of me to my current career, I pursued languages and teaching languages，and um I uh eventually came up with the idea of doing the different things I do now, so that original goal kind of me to my current career. 

发言人1   22:40
So that's great. IT wasn't a complete waste, right.

发言人1   22:44
And lastly, let me include one a bonus dream.

发言人1   22:49
Uh I call IT a bonus dream, because I still kind of have IT, but it's a very distant dream that I don't think I'll ever accomplish, but I still think about how cool would be to do this in the future.

发言人1   23:06
So I won't say that the chances are zero, I might uh at some point in my life, somehow find the opportunity to do this, but I doubt IT and that unrealistic, distant dream that I don't really plan on accomplishing。

发言人1   23:28
Is opening a breakfast restaurant. I love breakfast. It's my favorite meal of the day. I love eating breakfast out of at restaurants.

发言人1   23:40
I don't really do IT nowadays in the US, unfortunately, because it's so expensive. 

发言人1   23:48
Ah but when I was in Mexico, I ate breakfast at restaurants all the time, and I think that my taste in breakfast is pretty good.

发言人1   24:00
I think I could put together an amazing breakfast menu by taking different ideas from my favorite restaurants，taking ideas from my favorite dishes I've had, and I would need to hire an amazing chef who could translate form those ideas into a reality. 

发言人1   24:24
Of course, I cannot cook, but um I think that I could give AA very good chef.

发言人1   24:33
Um the ideas to work on, and I think I could also uh uh like a really cool environment for a breakfast restaurant。

发言人1   24:47
I have a lot of experience eating breakfast at restaurants, so that's why I say that.

发言人1   24:54
I think that I could be successful in in that, and I'm passionate about good breakfast food. 

发言人1   25:02
So ah that's a distant dream that I talk about with my wife sometimes, but I don't think it'll ever happen.

发言人1   25:11
But maybe I would say there's maybe a 1% chance that this one happens, so it's not failed yet. 

发言人1   25:20
Well, I hope that you enjoyed hearing about all my failed dreams, and I hope that this episode was good practice for your listening.

发言人1   26:00
And if you can write a review.All right, thank you so much for listening to this episode, and I'll talk to you on the next episode of listening time.

发言人1   26:20
Hey, everybody, welcome to another phrase over episode. I hope you're doing great.

发言人1   26:26
I hope your english learning is growing well, and I hope that you feel like you know a lot more phrasal verbs. 

发言人1   26:34
Now since you started listening to these phrases, verb episodes and in today's episode, we are gonna look at two phrasal verbs.

发言人1   26:44
The first one is block off, and the second one is blow away. So let's first define these two phrasal verbs.

发言人2   26:55
Block off .

发言人1   26:56
means to obstruct or block some area using a barrier. 

发言人1   27:03
So for example, I could say part of the central square was blocked off for the special event.

发言人1   27:11
So what I'm saying here is that the authorities maybe um blocked part of this central square using some type of barrier，maybe that a police tape or some other type of barrier uh so that people couldn't PaaS and go through or go around that barrier because they were having a special event there。

发言人1   27:43
So they blocked IT off, and the other phrasal verb is a blow away.

发言人1   27:50
So this means to impress some one greatly. For example, I could say the last part of the movie blew me away.

发言人1   28:00
What I'm saying here is that the end of the movie was just really incredible in some way. IT really impressed me, surprised me. IT moved me in some great way. IT blew me away. 

发言人1   28:17
And okay, now I'm gonna talk about a couple different things.

发言人1   28:24
And while I talk, I'm going to use these two phrasal verbs over and over again so that you can get accustomed to hearing them in different sentences, get a feel for them.

发言人1   28:38
And hopefully, by the end of this episode, you'll know these phrasal verbs. well.

发言人1   28:43
So I'm first going to talk about a real story that happened recently, and I'll embellish IT a little bit, meaning I'll add some of details that aren't exactly true. 

发言人1   29:01
Uh just to exaggerate a little bit. But the story itself actually happened。

发言人1   29:08
Uh and that is when we were in Mexico a few months ago, and we got stuck at the top of this big hill in a town called at letz. co. And I talked about this in a normal episode.

发言人1   29:27
Actually, um what happened uh was that we got to the top of this hill. And then a raging thunder storm arrived.

发言人1   29:40
IT touched down at that exact moment that we reached, uh not the very top, but a high point on this hill，and luckily we had some cover over us。

发言人1   29:58
There was like this part, of some type of roof，let's say, uh where we could stand under for a while, but uh IT was a really bad thunderstorm, and um we weren't even that protected under this roof.

发言人1   30:20
And after a while we were able to talk to one of the workers that was in the area.

发言人1   30:30
He was the guy who delivers water to the different parts of the town, I think, um because he had a bunch of water in the jugs.
